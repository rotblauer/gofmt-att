Hi @gdamore, Thanks for voicing your concern.

I'm going to address your points in order of importance.

```
The idea of "drive by" submitting PRs against a bunch of projects that you have no former affiliation with, and which are only based upon being in Golang, feels kind of slimy to me.
```

I can assure you, there is nothing "slimy" about this project.

Here's why:
1.1. You're here. You knew where to come, and here I am too. In fact, I _invited_ you
to come here and do exactly this - voice any concerns or annoyances.
I could have run this from behind closed doors with a alias account, and we wouldn't
be having this conversation; that might have been slimy. Slimy means dodging
accountability or responsibility, and usually it involves sacrificing
integrity for selfish reasons. I can assure you that is not going on.

1.2. I am using all means available to me to make this project as __positive and helpful__ as possible.

- __I'm developing incrementally and with attention to feedback.__

This project is in its infancy and I have only run the program in intermittent
small batches. Actually, I haven't run the program for more than hour _in total_. 
After each batch, I supervise the resulting PRS to get feedback on if it's creating a positive
impact, and what I can do to improve. I'm following up with real people as a real person.
Furthermore, I been dealing politely with the robots asking me to sign CLAs, reformat
my commit messages, and read code coverage reports.

Following up with the outcomes of the PRs is critical to developing and improving a service

1.3.

One of the first and most critical rules about this project is to _never create duplicate PRs_.
As you'll read over on #1, I'm deliberately and ongoing-ly working to avoid that at all costs.






I have done and am doing everything about this project with an aim
